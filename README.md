# CSC435_JokeServer_Project
Joke Server project is a multithreaded java project that allows multiple client to receive jokes or proverbs from the server. 

This project has been developed under the guidance of Dr. Clark Elliott for the course CSC435 - Distributed Systems 1 at DePaul University.

The code has been added to Git for keeping track of its versions and to showcase projects developed by me as a part of my portfolio. This code is solely my work with inspiration from Dr . Elliott's InetServer source code provided to all students during the coursework. This project should not be copied by other students as they will risk plagirism consequences.
